	  used. See Issue622.

2012-01-17 04:57  tan2

	* INSTALL: updated installation instruction

2012-01-17 02:41  tan2

	  lib/Pan_problem_misc_functions.c, lib/Topo_gravity.c,
	  lib/Viscosity_structures.c: Made sure that compositional
	  viscosity without compositional buoyancy can be assigned without
	  setting ibuoy=1 and the buoyancy number to zero.

2011-12-20 18:04  becker

	* lib/Ggrd_handling.c, lib/Instructions.c, lib/Topo_gravity.c,
	  lib/global_defs.h: Merged with recent check in, minor changes.

2011-11-14 05:06  tan2

	* lib/Regional_boundary_conditions.c: Fixed a bug in reflective TBC
	  where y-index should be used, not z-index. The bug is harmless
	  though.
	  
	  I checked the code history. This bug exists since CitcomS 1.0,
	  but not in CitcomCU nor CitcomT.

2011-10-14 18:27  tan2

	* lib/Output_h5.c: fixed a bug that h5close_field() didn't have a
	  return statement, reported by Nicolas Flament in issue611.

2011-09-18 03:54  tan2

	* lib/Initial_temperature.c: fixed a bug that when the perturblayer
	  is on the internal boundary, the temperature perturbation wasn't
	  added to the lower processor.

2011-07-31 20:38  becker

	* lib/Ggrd_handling.c, lib/Initial_temperature.c,

	* CitcomS/Components/Output.py, lib/Instructions.c, lib/Output.c,
	  lib/Output_vtk.c, lib/global_defs.h, module/setProperties.c:
	  enhancing VTK output, mostly contributed by Rene Gassmoeller at
	  GFZ.
	  
	  - A new input parameter 'vtk_format', which can be either 'ascii'
	  (default) or 'binary'. When 'binary', gzip and base64 encoding
	  are used. - The node ordering is changed to CitcomS native
	  ordering. The consequence is the axis are rotated as z in CitcomS
	  is mapped to X in vtk, and x to Y, y to Z. - More data can be
	  outputted in vtk format - Using .pvts file for regional model;
	  .vtm and .visit file for global model (.vtm format provided by
	  Tobias Hoeink at Rice, .visit format provided by Kat at
	  visitusers.org/forum)

	* lib/Drive_solvers.c, lib/Instructions.c, lib/global_defs.h: Added
	  a flag force_iteration which if on (off by default), will enforce
	  an iterative solution to the velocity fields even if linear
	  rheologies were chosen. This is useful for debugging/robustness
	  tests.

	* lib/Citcom_init.c, lib/Tracer_setup.c: Removed the srand() call
	  that seemed like a good idea (rev. 17175) but screwed up
	  tracer-based runs with large number of processors (12x3x3x2).
	  Weird, but oh well. Someone advise why this didn't work?

2011-02-07 19:00  becker

	* lib/Ggrd_handling.c: Added one missing line for anisotropic
	  viscosity init.

2011-02-07 00:32  becker

	* lib/Ggrd_handling.c: Reversed, temporarily, the use of

	  computations with previous versions.

2011-02-06 23:57  becker

	* lib/Full_boundary_conditions.c: Fixed typo that was introduced in
	  17555 and made temperature field assignment apparently screwed

	* lib/BC_util.c, lib/Full_boundary_conditions.c,
	  lib/Regional_boundary_conditions.c, lib/prototypes.h: Reverted to
	  separate horizontal_bc routines for regional and full. the former
	  has a check for
	  
	  ROW==E->lmesh.NOZ[level] &&
	  E->parallel.me_loc[3]==E->parallel.nprocz-1
	  
	  while the full version has
	  
	  ROW==E->mesh.NOZ[level]) &&
	  (E->parallel.me_loc[3]==E->parallel.nprocz-1) )

2010-12-08 20:14  becker

	* lib/BC_util.c: Reverted the rowl adjustment since it didn't fix
	  the problem reported by Dan.

2010-12-08 18:43  becker

	* lib/global_defs.h: Added definition of TRUE (1) and FALSE (0) in
	  case undefined (was defined for GMT/ggrd compile before).

2010-12-08 00:54  becker

	* lib/BC_util.c: Addded a test for top or bottom nodal row back
	  into horizontal_bc (earlier moved from
	  Regional_boundary_conditions and Full_boundary_conditions to
	  BC_util.c) to see if this helps fix a bug reported by Dan that I
	  could not reproduce in the non-pyre version.

2010-10-12 06:36  becker

	* lib/Anisotropic_viscosity.c, lib/Drive_solvers.c,

	  Anisotropic viscosity is set up more flexibly.

2010-09-07 07:05  becker

	* lib/Ggrd_handling.c, lib/Instructions.c, lib/Output_gzdir.c,
	  lib/Viscosity_structures.c, lib/global_defs.h: Made sure that
	  viscosity prefactors get assigned for material dependent
	  viscosity only (TDEPV = off)

2010-09-07 02:22  becker

	* lib/Citcom_init.c, lib/Tracer_setup.c: Added random number
	  generator initialization to ensure exact reproducibility of all
	  runs, including those with tracers.
	  
	  Earlier reported solver issues might be related to our cluster,
	  at least all revisions seems to give the same answer now.

2010-09-07 01:40  becker

	* lib/Anisotropic_viscosity.c, lib/Ggrd_handling.c,
	  lib/Nodal_mesh.c, lib/Viscosity_structures.c,
	  lib/viscosity_descriptions.h: Checking in current version because
	  of need for debugging.
	  
	  Revision 17172, compared to (presumably) 17153 give strange
	  multigrid convergence behavior. Checking why that is now.

2010-09-06 05:20  becker

	* CitcomS/Coupler/Coupler.py, module/Exchanger/BaseSVTInlet.cc,
	  module/Exchanger/BaseSVTInlet.h: Added support of multigrid
	  solver in Exchanger. Lifted the solver assertion in Coupler.
	  
	  Cookbook9 can be converted to multigrid solver once appropriate
	  parameters (*solver.mesher.levels=2 and
	  *solver.vsolver.Solver=multigrid) are added. However, the
	  embedded solver will converge incorrectly. Setting
	  esolver.vsolver.accuracy=6e-3 seems to fix the problem.

2010-05-25 02:47  becker

	* lib/BC_util.c: And a typo fix.

2010-05-24 18:00  becker

	* lib/BC_util.c, lib/Ggrd_handling.c, lib/Initial_temperature.c,
	  lib/Instructions.c, lib/ggrd_handling.h, lib/global_defs.h:
	  toplayerbc > 0 will now assign BCs for all noes with r >=
	  toplayerbc_r, which defaults to 0.984303876942 i.e. 100 km depth.
	  (Still experimental.)

2010-03-12 00:41  becker

	* lib/BC_util.c, lib/Ggrd_handling.c: Improvements for internal
	  BCs.

2010-03-10 19:55  becker

	* lib/BC_util.c, lib/Ggrd_handling.c, lib/Topo_gravity.c: This
	  logic should make more sense for internal BCs, but still testing.

2010-03-10 19:38  becker

	  lib/Ggrd_handling.c, lib/Instructions.c,
	  lib/Regional_boundary_conditions.c, lib/Topo_gravity.c,
	  lib/global_defs.h: Experimental implementation of a single node
	  layer for internal boundary condition assignment, assigned if
	  toplayerbc < 0, to nodes at layer noz+toplayerbc, but only for
	  the top level multigrid, for now.

2010-02-26 21:04  walter

	* lib/Topo_gravity.c: Fix a misleading comment

2010-02-02 23:41  walter

	* Makefile.am: Fix an error when running autoreconf -i

2010-02-01 19:43  becker

	* lib/Viscosity_structures.c, lib/viscosity_descriptions.h: Changed
	  internal variable name for use_se_smoothing, as per Eh's
	  suggestion.

2010-01-29 14:48  becker

	* lib/Viscosity_structures.c, lib/viscosity_descriptions.h: Added
	  old CitcomS element -> nodes -> element viscosity smoothing with

2010-01-21 21:23  tan2

	* CitcomS/Components/Stokes_solver/Incompressible.py,

2010-01-21 21:22  tan2

	* module/Exchanger/CitcomInterpolator.cc: Replaced fixed accuracy
	  setting. Bug reported by Rob Moucha.

2010-01-21 20:11  tan2

	* visual/OpenDXMacro/CitcomSImportOpt.net, visual/visFull.cfg,
	  visual/visFull.net.in: Added opendx macro to visualize opt (e.g.
	  composition) fields. This fixed Issue99.

2010-01-17 01:19  danb

	* lib/Composition_related.c, lib/Tracer_setup.c, lib/tracer_defs.h:
	  Preliminary support for the absolute tracer method. Only tested
	  with one flavor, reading in from a file, and the initial volume
	  of the tracers is HARD-CODED! In addition, the code automaticaly
	  truncates the composition to one, although this should be a
	  switch for the user to specify.

2010-01-16 02:47  becker

	* lib/Instructions.c, lib/Nodal_mesh.c, lib/Stokes_flow_Incomp.c,
	  lib/Viscosity_structures.c, lib/global_defs.h: Implementation of
	  two, perhaps entirely unnecessary features, in search of why
	  certain prescribed velocity models do not converge like they
	  should.
	  
	  - allow for each inner loop solution to have a higher accuracy
	  than the outer, Uzawa loop. This is set by new parameter
	  "inner_accuracy_scale", which pre-multiplies the inner accuracy
	  (imp) setting (defaults to unity)
	  
	  - remove any rigid body rotation at each Uzawa iteration step.
	  Parmaeter "inner_remove_rigid_rotation", by default off. For
	  this, I also added an experimental routine assign_v_to_vector()
	  in order to reasign the V velocities to the U solution vector
	  after removing the net rotations from V (how is supposed to work
	  for the regular operational mode?)

2009-12-09 02:25  tan2

	* lib/BC_util.c: Replaced TRUE and FALSE. Added function
	  prototypes.

2009-12-08 21:44  tan2

	* CitcomS/Components/Stokes_solver/Incompressible.py,
	  lib/Instructions.c, lib/Stokes_flow_Incomp.c, lib/global_defs.h,
	  module/setProperties.c: Added two boolean parameters for

	  check_continuity_convergence (default=on): include div/v in the
	  criterion. check_pressure_convergence (default=on): include dp/p
	  in the criterion.
	  
	  Retired the parameter: only_check_vel_convergence.

	* lib/BC_util.c: Modified handling of internal BCs, as per Eh's
	  suggestion, now handled in a separate function.

2009-12-04 21:57  tan2

	* README: Removed metioning the version number in README. Added the

2009-12-04 02:33  becker

	* lib/Full_boundary_conditions.c, lib/Ggrd_handling.c,

	  lib/global_defs.h: Experimental implementation of internal stress
	  or velocity boundary conditions. As of right now, toplayerbc > 0
	  (default = 0) will assign the surface boundary condition to all
	  nodes within the first toplayerbc layers. If BCs are assigned
	  from file, this will only work for the grd method, not the
	  regular file I/O.

2009-11-21 00:15  becker

	* lib/Instructions.c, lib/Stokes_flow_Incomp.c, lib/global_defs.h:
	  Exit criterion for incompressibility iteration allowed for
	  velocity and pressure convergence at finite compressibility >
	  accuracy. Changed criterion to loop while (convergence < 2) OR
	  (compressibility < imp)

	  to generate a "dot" graph of the expression tree. Of course, this
	  tree is too big to plot in its entirety. With neq == 2187, the
	  tree has 87479 nodes and is 355 levels deep; each level can have
	  anywhere from a handful to several hundred nodes, with over a
	  thousand nodes in each of the bottommost layers.

2008-06-19 01:04  tan2

	* lib/Size_does_matter.c, lib/Sphere_harmonics.c: Compute
	  E->surf_det (top surface area, ie. surface jacobian, of an
	  element) on a unit sphere.
	  
	  Use E->surf_det, instead of the surface jacobian returned by
	  get_global_1d_shape_fn(), to expand spherical harmonics.
	  
	  The surface jacobian returned by get_global_1d_shape_fn() is
	  defined at the top radius of the current mesh. When nprocz>1, the
	  top radius is not the same as the outer radius of the sphere for
	  processors. As a result, the spherical harmonics expansion gave
	  incorrect result when nprocz>1 in the previous revisions.

	  # # read initial temperature conditions from grd files (default
	  values in parentheses) # tic_method=4 # read initial temperature

	* lib/Instructions.c, lib/Output.c, lib/Output_gzdir.c,
	  lib/Output_h5.c, lib/Parsing.c: - merged changes with Eh's
	  additions
	  
	  - added coor=2 option (for full citcom) to assign finer radial
	  node spacing to top and lower layers of shell. The
	  coor_refine=0.1,0.15,0.1,0.2 parameter specifies the radius
	  fraction of the bottom layer [0], the fraction of the nodes in
	  this layer [1], the top layer fraction [2], and the top layer
	  node fraction [3]. I.e. the defaults will put 15% of all nz nodes
	  into the 10% lower layer, 20% in the top 10% upper layer, and the
	  rest in between.
	  
	  - renamed gzipped output option ascii-gz
	  
	  - built in restart facilities for temperature and tracers when
	  using gzdir I/O
	  
	  - added a composition viscosity function, CDEPV, based on two
	  tracer flavors
	  
	  - for this to work, I had to move viscosity_input() *behind*
	  tic_input() and tracer_input() in instructions
	  
	  - added tracer_enriched option. If tracer = on and
	  tracer_enriched = on, will reader Q0_enriched and vary the
	  element heat production between Q0 for C = 0 and Q0_enriched for
	  C = 1. I.e. this only works if C varies between 0 and 1.
	  
	  - added an experimental option to write to a single VTK file
	  (note caveats!) if ascii-gz is activated
	  
	  gzdir_vtkio = 2, will try to write VTK straight (experimental)
	  
	  the VTK output is of the "legacy", serial type, and requires that
	  all processors see the same filesystem. This will likely lead to
	  a bottleneck for larg CPU computations as each processor has to
	  wait til the previous is done.

	  lib/Construct_arrays.c, lib/Full_tracer_advection.c,
	  lib/General_matrix_functions.c, lib/Ggrd_handling.c,
	  lib/Instructions.c, lib/Makefile.am, lib/Output.c,
	  lib/Output_gzdir.c, lib/Pan_problem_misc_functions.c,
	  lib/Tracer_setup.c, lib/Viscosity_structures.c,
	  lib/global_defs.h, lib/tracer_defs.h: - added new routine
	  Ggrd_handling which will take care of netcdf grd input. For now,
	  only the tracer innitial conditions can be set by using, for
	  example,
	  
	  ictracer_grd_layers=2 ictracer_grd_file="tmask.grd"
	  
	  for this to work, the ggrd libraries from HC, as well as the
	  -lgmt and -lnetcdf need to be linked, and -DUSE_GGRD needs to be
	  defined on compile time.
	  
	  - rewrote TDEPV viscosity options 3 and 4 slightly to make them
	  more efficient
	  
	  - added TDEPV viscosity option 6
	  
	  eta = N_0 exp(E(T_0-T) + (1-z) Z_0 )
	  
	  - took layers subroutine in Construct_arrays.c apart to allow
	  calling the same function in a more flexible from other
	  subroutines
	  
	  - addded error handling routine "myerror" to
	  Pan_problem_misc_functions
	  
	  - made the output behavior of the multigrid solver convergence
	  parameters consisent with verbosity setting (ie. use report
	  instead of always stderr output)
	  
	  - changed tracer input parameter "tracer" and "chemical_buoyancy"
	  to boolean routine for added flexibility (I hope)
	  
	  - made check_initial_composition consistent with tracer
	  advection, exits after warning only for
	  E->trace.itracer_warnings==1
	  
	  - debugging output in Full_tracer_advection.c and Tracer_setup
	  only gets printed to file for E->control.verbose == 1
	  
	  - fixed some typos in Output_gzdir (that might have been
	  introduced by asynchronous svn updating or something like that)

	* lib/Output_gzdir.c: Forgot to actually add the new file that is

	* lib/Advection_diffusion.c, lib/Drive_solvers.c,
	  lib/Instructions.c, lib/Makefile.am, lib/Output.c,
	  lib/Pan_problem_misc_functions.c, lib/Stokes_flow_Incomp.c,
	  lib/Viscosity_structures.c, lib/global_defs.h, lib/output.h,
	  lib/viscosity_descriptions.h: - added functions rtp2xyz,
	  calc_cbase_at_tp, and convert_pvec_to_cvec for spherical to
	  Cartesian vector conversion to Pan_problem_functions.c
	  
	  Added "safe_malloc" to the same file because I didn't like the
	  way Malloc1 uses int as arguments (64 bit issues).
	  
	  - added support for gzipped ascii output into subdirectories of
	  data_dir, option gzdir. To use, need to compile with USE_GZDIR
	  and link with the -lz zlib libraries. Within gzdir output mode,
	  selected by
	  
	  output_format=gzdir user can define vtk I/O (gzdir_vtkio=1) to
	  write Cartesian coordinates and velocities that are easy to
	  combine to a single vtk file in a post-processing step.
	  
	  If gzlib_vtkio=0 the gzdir output option is meant to be identical
	  to the original ascii output, but files are all gzipped on the
	  fly, and the output that changes with each cycle is placed into
	  subdirectories of data_dir/ called data_dir/cycles/ For gzdir
	  I/O, data_name is not used at all, all single output files are
	  placed in the data_dir/ directory without prefix.
	  
	  - added a new rheology option, PDEPV, for pseudo-plasticity and
	  added a corresponding description to the manual.
	  
	  - Modified Drive_solver stderr output to show v.v, and not only
	  dv.dv/v.v

	* lib/Full_read_input_from_files.c: The functionality of this
	  routine is now expanded so that for evey time step the element
	  materials are read in. The code for determining the material file
	  names and opening the file name and then reading in the element
	  files is placed in the same code that the age grids and velocity
	  files are processed. Obviously, reading in materials currently
	  only works for Full; fill be working on Regional next.

2007-01-29 20:46  gurnis

	* lib/Advection_diffusion.c, lib/BC_util.c, lib/Instructions.c,
	  lib/Problem_related.c: Changed the seequence placement in the
	  time step when the age grids are assimilated into the temperature
	  field. Previously, going back to the original code contributed by
	  CC, the assimilation occurred avery time the temperature BCs were
	  set (meaning multiple times in a PC loop). Now assimilation
	  happens only once at the end of the time step. This is placed at
	  the end of the routine PG_time_step_solve. Once we have worked
	  with this some more, we will want to expose this code at a higher
	  level so that assimulation will work properly from either plain C
	  code or the Pyre version. Currently only tested with Full.

	  The previous code computed and stored the Cartesian velocity in
	  E->temp in v_from_vector() and accessed E->temp in
	  velo_from_element. This is bug prone. E->temp is a temporary
	  array and should be used for storage.
	  
	  Also, in previous code, if E->sphere.cap[m].V is modified, one
	  has to recompute E->temp. Otherwise, the Cartesian velocity will
	  be incorrect.

	  !@#$%*
	  
	  The .pth/sitedir/sys.path/PYTHONPATH aspect of eggs is really
	  irritating. I hope setuptools becomes a part of the standard
	  Python distro, as the Python core developers are likely to accept
	  it uncritically and unmodified (as they are wont to do,
	  apparently -- judging by all the other crap that is in the
	  standard library). God willing, this will further accelerate the
	  death of the language.

	  Using a pidXXXX.cfg file as input should "work" now, although it
	  still doesn't reproduce the original simulation, since at least
	  one parameter is missing ('steps'). I maintain that dumping the
	  configuration is really the job of the framework (Pyre).
	  Unfortunately, Pyre's current capabilities in this area are buggy
	  in the case of '.pml' files, and non-existent in the case of
	  '.cfg' files.
	  
	  Note: 'nproc_surf' is now a real inventory item, instead of a
	  fake one. It looks like it doesn't belong in the inventory at
	  all, though. (I left it there to avoid breakage.)

	  the "ascii-local" option is gone * "datafile" becomes the prefix
	  of the filename and cannot contain "/" * "datadir" becomes
	  mandatory input parameters * If "datadir" is "%DATADIR", the
	  output directory is determined by an external program
	  "citcoms_datadir" * Special substrings "%RANK", "%HOSTNAME" in
	  datadir will be substituted by mpi rank, machine's hostname,
	  $DATADIR environment variable, respectively. * These special
	  strings start with "%", rather than "$", becuase it's very
	  difficult to input "$" from the command line.

	  Call addsitedir() in the 'citcoms' script. I guess this is now
	  necessary since "site.py" is no longer in the same directory as
	  "citcoms". (*)
	  
	  Note that there is currently a bug in Merlin which prevents
	  'citcoms' from running ("No module named pkg_resources"). The
	  work-around is to manually add the merlin egg to the
	  merlin-install.pth file.
	  
	  There are more bugs which prevent running on Mac OS X at all
	  (still investigating).
	  
	  (*) I'm becoming annoyed with setuptools' use of .pth files as a
	  sys.path/PYTHONPATH persistence mechanism, mainly because of the
	  accompanying hacks which are used to turn ordinary directories
	  into "site" directories (i.e., directories where .pth files work)
	  -- these ugly, confusing hacks include the fake site.py, "virtual
	  python", etc. I think Merlin will only use .pth files in real
	  site directories. It will use clear, straitforward, direct
	  sys.path manipulation everywhere else.

	  As I was revising the "Installation" chapter of the manual (still
	  in progress), I got frustrated with how complicated everything
	  was -- and how difficult it was to document that complexity -- so
	  I did something slightly violent:
	  
	  Converted the CitcomS extension module, 'CitcomSLib', from C++ to
	  C. This is made possible by Pythia 0.8.1.0b2, which replaces
	  _mpimodule with _mpi.pyx, which has a C interface.
	  
	  It is now possible to build CitcomS -- and all its prerequisites
	  (e.g. Python) -- entirely from source, starting with nothing but
	  a C compiler. Exchanger still requires C++, of course. I have yet
	  to test these changes with Exchanger enabled, but I don't
	  anticipate any serious problems.
	  
	  This may have been overkill, but I also cleaned the source of
	  C++-style comments (even though most modern C compilers probably
	  accept them... it became standard in C99 or something).
	  
	  I'll bet you can install CitcomS with GCC 2.x now :-)

	* bin/Makefile.am, bin/pycitcoms.cc, configure.ac, ez_setup.py,
	  module/Exchanger/Makefile.am, module/Makefile.am, setup.py: Made
	  'Exchanger' optional. Give "--with-exchanger=[yes|no]" as an
	  argument to 'configure' to manually specify whether you want
	  Exchanger; the default is "auto", which means to use Exchanger if
	  it's installed (and on your PYTHONPATH).
	  
	  Egg-ified 'configure' checks for Python packages. This means that
	  CitcomS now requires the egg-ified CIG version of Pythia -- and
	  (optionally) the egg-ified Exchanger. Old Pythia/Exchanger
	  installations will not work, as they lack the egg-metadata
	  ('configure' will act as if they are not installed).
	  
	  Added 'setup.py', which will automatically download and install
	  the egg version of Pythia -- as well as the egg system itself
	  ('setuptools'). If you want Exchanger, you still must install it
	  manually (the way C++ is used prevents complete egg-ification of
	  Exchanger). Note that 'setup.py' actually checks-out the latest
	  Pythia from the SVN repository. The release version of CitcomS
	  will download a packaged Pythia from the website instead.

	  and restart=1, the restart files will be read from
	  ${datadir_old}/${rank}/${datafile_old}.velo.${rank}.${step}. In

	  output_format=="ascii-local" (the default), CitcomS will write
	  ascii files to the directory and prefix specified by "datafile",
	  ie., the same behavior as in v2.0 * If output_format=="ascii",
	  CitcomS will write ascii files to the directory specified by
	  "datadir" with the prefix specified by "datafile". In the case,
	  "datafile" cannot contains the '/' (path seperator) character. *
	  If output_format=="hdf5", CitcomS will write singe HDf5 file to
	  the directory and prefix specified by "datafile".

2006-09-21 17:51  tan2

	  changes * open .time file at either mesher.cc (for pyre run) or
	  Instructions.c (for C run) * .time file is opened and closed only
	  by the rank-0 processor. This will avoid multiple processors
	  opening/writing/closing on the same file. Similar modification is
	  necessary for the .log file. * created two variables
	  E->monitor.cpu_time_at_start and
	  E->monitor.cpu_time_at_last_cycles for storing the wall clock
	  time at startup and last timestep, respectively * output .time
	  file in output_time() in Output.c

	  the capability to embed Python instead of extending it. This
	  creates one, big monolithic executable, 'pycitcoms', which
	  contains all CitcomS code and an embedded Python interpreter.
	  Embedding works-around MPI portability issues. (See issue15 for
	  details.) Embed by default.
	  
	  Configure with '--disable-embedding' to build the old way with
	  ".so" extension modules. This is *NOT* guaranteed to work unless
	  you have a shared MPI library. The ugly hacks which made it work
	  in the past (even with a static "libmpich.a", for example) are no
	  longer supported.
	  
	  Merged "Full" and "Regional" into a single library to cut down on
	  redundancy, both in the source code and in the amount of object
	  code which is produced. (I performed this merge so that I would
	  only need a single 'pycitcoms' intepreter, instead of two.)

	  in unusual cases. Also, 'sed' the install-time PYTHONPATH into
	  CitComS scripts (instead of an explicit list of @pythondir@'s).
	  
	  Added _getPrivateDepositoryLocations() and CitcomS.pml. Changed
	  "etc/citcoms" to "etc/CitcomS" for consistency with the Python
	  package name. Add PACKAGE_VERSION to __init__.py, and added
	  pyconfig-generated config.py. Freeze the full path to 'mpirun'

	  invovled creating CitcomS's own version of LauncherMPICH, and
	  tweaking the MPI launchers so that CitcomS re-execs itself under
	  'mpipython.exe' when it is run under plain old 'python'. Also:
	  made "--launcher.dry" work; ignore 'nodegen' in LauncherBatch (so
	  that the examples "just work" on the TeraGrid); added some 'tips'
