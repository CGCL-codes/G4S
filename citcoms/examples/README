Note regarding examples:

The Cookbook examples in this directory are designed for the Pyre enabled
version of CitcomS ("./configure --with-pyre").  In the current version of
CitcomS, Pyre is disabled by default.  If you want to use the Cookbook
examples you must configure CitcomS with Pyre enabled.  Otherwise, you can
use the Regional and Full examples in this directory with Pyre disabled.
